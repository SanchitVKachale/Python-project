Myself Sanchit Kachale. 
This is a python project in which we have done Exploratory Data Analysis using python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to draw insights from Diwali Sales.     
Thanks to Rishabh Mishra sir for helping create this project and teaching how analysis can be done using Python Language through Jupyter Notebook.
